Hi there,

Thank you for your email.

I am sorry for any concern these unexpected charges may have caused.

Upon reviewing your account, I found that the charges are related to RDS storage which exceeded the scope of our Free Tier usage limits, therefore accruing charges.

However, I can that confirm the resources have already been deleted which has stopped additional charges from accruing. Therefore, I’m pleased to inform you that as a one time
 exception we’ve approved a billing adjustment of $0.16 for the usage charges on your June bill.

The billing adjustment has been processed in the following form:

* June bill ==> Waived the amount of $0.16 from your account.

***It is important to note that our Free Tier promotion allows you to test some AWS services free-of-charge within certain usage limits, and is automatically available to 
new AWS customers for 12 months. When your application use exceeds what's covered by the Free Tier, you simply pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates.

For more details, you can review the AWS Free Usage Tier FAQs, along with the Free Tier "Getting Started" guide:
